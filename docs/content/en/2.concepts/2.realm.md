# Realm

A **Realm** in FerrisKey represents an isolated environment that enables multi-tenant application management. Think of a Realm as a secure, independent workspace where different organizations, teams, or environments can operate without interfering with each other.

## What is a Realm?

A Realm is a logical boundary that provides:

- **Complete isolation** between different tenants
- **Independent configuration** for authentication, authorization, and security policies
- **Separate user management** with distinct user bases
- **Isolated data storage** ensuring tenant data privacy
- **Customizable branding** and user experience per tenant

::prose-tip
Realms enable you to serve multiple customers or organizational units from a single FerrisKey deployment while maintaining strict separation between them.

## Key Concepts

### Tenant Isolation

Each Realm operates as a completely separate entity:

**Security Boundary**
Users, roles, and permissions in one Realm cannot access resources in another Realm. This ensures complete tenant isolation and data privacy.
::


### Independent Configuration

Every Realm maintains its own:

- **Authentication providers** (OAuth, SAML, LDAP, etc.)
- **User stores** and identity sources
- **Password policies** and security rules
- **Session management** settings
- **API keys** and client credentials
- **Custom attributes** and user schemas

### Multi-Environment Support

Realms are perfect for managing different environments:

- **Production** - Live customer-facing applications
- **Staging** - Pre-production testing and validation
- **Development** - Active development and experimentation
- **Customer Demo** - Isolated demo environments for prospects

## Use Cases

### SaaS Multi-Tenancy

For Software-as-a-Service applications serving multiple customers:


:icon{name="i-lucide-building"} **Customer A Realm** 

Isolated environment for Customer A with their specific authentication requirements, user base, and security policies.

### Enterprise Divisions

Large organizations can use Realms to separate different business units:

- **HR Division** - Employee management and internal apps
- **Customer Support** - External customer portals
- **Partner Network** - Third-party integrations and access

### Environment Management

Development teams can maintain separate Realms for each stage of their deployment pipeline:

| Environment | Purpose | Users |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Development | Active coding and testing | Developers, QA teams |
| Staging | Pre-production validation | Product managers, stakeholders |
| Production | Live customer applications | End users, customers |

## Realm Features

### User Management

Each Realm provides independent user management capabilities:

- **User registration** and onboarding flows
- **Profile management** and custom attributes
- **Group and role assignments** specific to the Realm
- **User lifecycle management** (activation, deactivation, deletion)

### Authentication & Authorization

Realms support flexible authentication configurations:

- **Multiple identity providers** per Realm
- **Custom login flows** and branding
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Attribute-based access control** (ABAC)
- **Fine-grained permissions** management

### Security Policies

Independent security configuration per Realm:

- **Password complexity** requirements
- **Multi-factor authentication** (MFA) policies
- **Session timeout** and security settings
- **Audit logging** and compliance tracking
- **Rate limiting** and abuse protection

## Benefits

### Operational Efficiency

- **Centralized management** of multiple tenants from a single platform
- **Reduced infrastructure** overhead compared to separate deployments
- **Consistent security** policies across environments
- **Simplified compliance** and audit processes

### Customer Experience

- **Branded environments** tailored to each tenant
- **Custom authentication** flows matching customer requirements
- **Isolated performance** ensuring one tenant doesn't affect others
- **Flexible integration** with existing customer systems

### Development Velocity

- **Environment parity** between development, staging, and production
- **Easy testing** of multi-tenant scenarios
- **Rapid deployment** of new customer environments
- **Consistent APIs** across all Realms

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent naming for your Realms:

::prose-callout{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb" color="amber"}
**Recommended Naming**

- `acme-corp-prod` - Production environment for Acme Corporation
- `beta-customer-staging` - Staging environment for beta customers  
- `internal-dev` - Development environment for internal teams
::

### Security Configuration

- **Enable MFA** for administrative access to Realm management
- **Regular audit** of user permissions and access patterns
- **Monitor cross-Realm** access attempts and suspicious activity
- **Backup configurations** before making significant changes

### Resource Planning

- **Monitor usage** across Realms to optimize resource allocation
- **Set appropriate limits** on users, sessions, and API calls per Realm
- **Plan capacity** for peak usage periods across all tenants
- **Archive inactive** Realms to maintain performance

::prose-note
Realms provide the foundation for secure, scalable multi-tenant applications. They enable you to serve diverse customers and use cases while maintaining the operational simplicity of a single FerrisKey deployment.
