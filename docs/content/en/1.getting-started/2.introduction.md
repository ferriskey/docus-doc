Welcome to **FerrisKey**, a modern Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution built with Rust for exceptional performance and security.

## What is FerrisKey?

FerrisKey is a modern identity and access management system.

In simple terms, it answers questions like:
- Who are your users ?
- How do they log in ? 
- What are they allowed to do ?
- How do you manage identities securely at scale ?

FerrisKey helps organizations centralize authentication and user management, while remaining secure, flexible, and cloud-native?

It is designed for modern applications, but its concepts remain easy to understand even for non-technical users.

## Getting Started

FerrisKey exists to make identity management clear, predictable, and secure.

Many systems grow complex over time:
- Users multiply
- Applications increase
- Permissions become difficult to track
- Security rules are scattered

FerrisKey brings all of this under one single source of truth.

It allows organizations to:
- Manage users in one place
- Controll access consistently
- Connect multiple applications safely
- Keep a clear view of who can access what

All of this is done with simplicity and transparency in mind.
