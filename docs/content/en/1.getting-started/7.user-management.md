# User Management

FerrisKey provides essential user management capabilities within each Realm. This guide covers the basic operations for managing users in your application.

## Overview

User management in FerrisKey is Realm-scoped, meaning users are isolated within their respective Realms. Each Realm maintains its own user base with independent profiles and credentials.

::prose-tip
All user management operations are performed within the context of a specific Realm, ensuring complete tenant isolation.

## User Operations

### User Registration

Users can be created through:

- **Self-registration** - Users sign up directly through your application
- **Admin creation** - Administrators create users manually
- **API provisioning** - Programmatic user creation via API

### User Authentication

FerrisKey supports multiple authentication methods:

- **Username/password** - Traditional credential-based login
- **Email/password** - Email as the primary identifier
- **Multi-factor authentication** - TOTP-based second factor

### Profile Management

Basic user profile information includes:

- **Username** - Unique identifier within the Realm
- **Email address** - Contact and recovery information
- **Display name** - User's preferred display name
- **Account status** - Active, inactive, or locked states

## User Attributes

### Standard Attributes

FerrisKey manages essential user attributes:

- `username` - Unique username within the Realm
- `email` - User's email address
- `firstName` - User's first name
- `lastName` - User's last name
- `enabled` - Account active status

### Account Status

Users can have different account states:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | User can authenticate and access applications |
| **Inactive** | User account is disabled, authentication blocked |
| **Locked** | Account temporarily locked due to security policies |

## Security Features

### Password Policies

Configure password requirements per Realm:

- **Minimum length** - Enforce password complexity
- **Character requirements** - Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Password history** - Prevent password reuse

### Account Protection

Built-in security measures:

- **Account lockout** - Automatic lockout after failed attempts
- **Password expiration** - Force password changes periodically
- **Audit logging** - Track user authentication events

## MFA Management

### TOTP Setup

Users can enable Time-based One-Time Passwords:

1. **QR Code generation** - Users scan QR code with authenticator app
2. **Secret sharing** - Manual entry for compatible apps
3. **Verification** - Confirm setup with test code
4. **Backup codes** - Recovery options for lost devices

### MFA Status

Track MFA enrollment per user:

- **Not configured** - User hasn't set up MFA
- **Configured** - TOTP is active and required
- **Disabled** - MFA temporarily disabled by admin

## Best Practices

### User Lifecycle

- **Onboarding** - Clear registration and setup process
- **Active management** - Regular review of user accounts
- **Offboarding** - Proper account deactivation when users leave

### Security Guidelines

- **Strong passwords** - Enforce robust password policies
- **MFA adoption** - Encourage or require multi-factor authentication
- **Regular audits** - Monitor user access patterns and permissions
- **Prompt deactivation** - Quickly disable accounts when needed

::prose-note
User management forms the foundation of your application's security. Start with basic operations and gradually implement more sophisticated policies as your requirements evolve.
